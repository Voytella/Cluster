  \frametitle{NAS-1 Emergency Mode}

  \begin{itemize}    
  \item NAS-1 booted into emergency mode after being turned off for the Hurricane.
  \item An error message appeared, saying that there was an, ``Un-Correctable DRAM ECC Error at CPU02/DIMM2A''
    %only after a couple of reboots though. Turn on = emercency mode, reboot, emergency mode, reboot emergency mode, left for the weekend,
    %turn off to mess with the APC, turn on, bam. 
  \item Michael and I swapped the RAM in slots 2A and 3A to make sure the issue was with the RAM instead of with the slot. 
  \item However, upon rebooting the error message did not appear, and NAS-1 booted into emergency mode again.
    %trying to turn it all the way off now
  \end{itemize}
