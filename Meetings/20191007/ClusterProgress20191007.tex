  \begin{itemize}
  \item The CE shut down unexpectedly Wednesday. 
  \item The fans on the back had a burning smell when I tried turning it back on. 
  \item There does not appear to be any physical damage to the CE, though there is a lot of dust inside.
  \item The power supply on the back, including the fan, cannot be opened to check for damage without voiding the warranty (if still active).
    % the website doesnt exist anymore, i couldnt find warranty documentation downstairs.
  \end{itemize}

%also nas-0 drives - zfs names are all weird and one drive is not being detected by the computer at all.
