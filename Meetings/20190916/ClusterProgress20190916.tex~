  \frametitle{NAS-1 Emergency Mode}

  \begin{itemize}    
  \item NAS-1 is continuing to boot into emergency mode.
  \item The indicator light on drive 0:21 lit up, indicating that the drive was failing.
  \item The command to replace the drive (storcli) could not be run due to controller 0 being in ``crit error''.
    %unsure if this is a raid card issue or if this is because of the bad drive and nas1 being unmounted
    %the last time a similar issue with nas-1 occoured, replacing the drive solved the issue.
  \item The faulty drive was replaced and began rebuilding, but soon afterwards controller 0 entered ``crit error'' state again.
    %unsure again if this is b/c of the drive or if it really is a faulty raid card.
    
    %We could get a SATA hub and use zfs, but we can't get the data off nas1 since /nas1 isn't mounted
    %Or, we could just replace the raid card, in which case I need to look up the model number and check to see if
    %the array metadata is copied onto the drives or not.

  \frametitle{APC Battery issues}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The indicator lights on the APC power supply have all turned off.
    %according to the manual, this means the batteries are recharging. But the apc has not turned back on yet
  \item The voltages on a few of the batteries are very low.
    %The batteries might need to be replaced. 
  \end{itemize}
