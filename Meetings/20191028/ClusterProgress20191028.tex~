  \frametitle{CE Offline}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The fans were cleaned, but this didn't seem to have an effect.
  \item The PSU's don't seem to be the issue, as was initially suspected. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The PSU's in the CE and the SE were identical, so I swapped the working PSU's from the SE into the CE.
      \item There was no change in the state of the CE, unfortunately. 
    \end{itemize} 
  \item When the power button is pressed, all hard drive slot LED's light up even if the slot is empty.
    %they light up green - not blue for activity. Its hard to find documentation for this but its either connection or error I think. 
    % the documentation website doesnt exist anymore (revamped), i couldnt find physical documentation either.
  \item This issue is still under investigation to find the root cause and a potential fix.
    %talked to Eric - probably a bad wire/connection or CPU
    %unplugged the connections between the PSU and the other components - no change - so might be the CPU but can't say for sure yet
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{NAS-1 Controller Failure}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The RAID Controller has again entered a crit fail state, though NAS-1 isn't in emergency mode this time.
    \item This issue is still under investigation as well. 
    \end{itemize}
  
  \end{frame}
%-----------END NAS-1---------

%tasks on hold:
% * nodes/spare APC
% * Tripplie monitoring software
% * OSG Software
% * Physically replace NAS-0 Drive - figure out the physical location (one is not being detected by the computer at all - naming is off)
% * Try fixing drives - need USB/SATA Cable (only half of it on the cluster desk)

\end{document}

%Still working on the list of scripts/data - theres a lot and NAS-0 usually connects to ethernet through the CE, which is down currently.
