  \item We discovered that it was trying to boot, but wouldn't POST
    %recognized network activity, fans spin, PSUs working
  \item A tech support ticket has been created
    %for access, NAS-0 now has the CE's static IP address. 
  \end{itemize}

%-----------END CE-----------

%tasks on hold:
% * NAS-1 controller failure
% * nodes/spare APC
% * Tripplie monitoring software
% * OSG Software
% * Physically replace NAS-0 Drive - figure out the physical location (one is not being detected by the computer at all - naming is off)
% * Try fixing drives - need USB/SATA Cable (only half of it on the cluster desk)
