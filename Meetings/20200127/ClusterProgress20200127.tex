  \begin{itemize}
  \item A spare hard drive is currently having an OS installed, to be used to create the zpool for the other 2 OS drives.
    % can't mirror a drive in use - ``rpool'' root pool stuff is solarus-specific. 
    % the installation took a few tries -> random errors that popped up then went away in the GUI that forced a reboot of the installer
    % creating the .iso was taking longer than I originally thought -> custom kickstart file, CD detection issues, etc.
    
    % plan -> create zpool and then run CentOS installer and see if it sees the pool or the physical disks, go from there
    %------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % node doesnt support USB booting.
    % cluster wont detect the CD -> so I need to make the liveCD with my computer at home

%tasks on hold:
% * NAS-1 controller failure - stuck on shutdown - waiting to see if it can figure itself out soon

% * nodes/spare APC
% * Tripplie monitoring software
% * OSG Software

% * Physically replace NAS-0 Drive - figure out the physical location (one is not being detected by the computer at all - naming is off)
% * Try fixing drives - need USB/SATA Cable (only half of it on the cluster desk)
